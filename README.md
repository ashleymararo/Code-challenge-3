# Post Manager

A simple, stylish blog post manager where you can add, view, edit, and delete posts — all from a soft and cozy interface.

Built with:
- HTML
- CSS (with pastel vibes)
- JavaScript
- JSON Server for the backend

---

## Features

- Add new blog posts with title, author, image, and content
- View a list of all posts
- See full details of each post
- Edit existing posts
- Delete posts with one click
- Fully styled layout with a soft, gentle UI (think cottage core meets productivity)

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashleymararo/Code-challenge-3
cd post-manager
```
2. Install JSON server if you don't have it.
```npm install -g json-server```
3. Start the backend and make sure you have a ```db.json``` file in the root. Then run:
```json-server --watch db.json --port 3000```
4. Start the frontend by opening ```index.html``` with Live Server in VS Code.
